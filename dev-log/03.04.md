# Day two

Got some initial setup with angular, I know how to do the socket stuff, now to make it pretty and easy.

---

Okay so, I think the build command is running out of memory, I think running on a beefier machine will help, when in doubt turn it up to 11.

Fine, I'm running it locally

I should probably prod the guys at MST once I get this running,
basically just gonna get the counter increasing when I get data from the socket

Was a good learning experience for me and they might still be interested.
