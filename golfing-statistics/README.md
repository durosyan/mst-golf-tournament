I wrote this little gem for MST-World who wanted me to make an angular application for them, I decided to figure out how to use EsBuild to build the application.
And I also decided to use the analogjs meta-framework for angular to make it easier to build the application.

I'm not sure if I'm going to use this meta-framework for my other angular applications, but I'm going to keep it in mind for the future.

I will keep notes on my progress here.
